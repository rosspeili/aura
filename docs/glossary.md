> **Optional reference** — terminology including ARPA-internal names. Product path: [concepts.md](concepts.md) and [INDEX.md](INDEX.md).

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **αύρα / AVRA / AURA** | Runtime coat / harness / field around the loop |
| **Body** | Host loop while running — script, Skillware, framework |
| **Membrane** | Ingress → body cavity → egress → audit sink |
| **Ingress** | Session-open boundary; normalized context enters the cavity |
| **Egress** | Policy gate before tool/skill execution leaves the cavity |
| **Observer** | Parallel audit trail subscriber (does not block host) |
| **Host** | Adapter that runs skills inside the body (`SkillwareHost`, mocks) |
| **Aura Manifest** | Birth declaration — type bindings + spectrum + optional sequencer |
| **AuraEvent** | Single append-only audit record |
| **Aura Spectrum** | Levels, services, budgets, output profiles — control plane |
| **Adapter** | Type plugin or runtime wrapper connecting foreign stack to harness |
| **Binding** | One `{ type, config }` entry in manifest |
| **Bridge** | Integration to ARPA stack (Live ID, Legacy, Rooms, …) |
| **Conformance (Job A)** | Runtime ⊆ declared manifest + sequencer order |
| **Audit trail** | Live append-only session log; code: audit spine / `AuraEvent` stream |
| **Session export** | Closed-session deliverable — JSONL + conformance summary JSON |
| **Constitution** | Rules, guardrails, constraints — what the run must obey |
| **Tools** | Skills, MCP, APIs, bundles — capability surface (adapter) |
| **Audit (Job B)** | Full causal log of session — same as audit trail |
| **Envelope** | Outer ring — identity, trust, Legacy export |
| **Field** | Parallel services on event stream |
| **Hook pipeline** | pre/post interception stages |
| **Live ID** | Permanent accountable identity (UBH) |
| **Logical Systems** | Brain — models, APIs, agents; rented not owned |
| **Manifest** | Same as Aura Manifest |
| **Middleware stack** | Ordered ops per step or model request |
| **Operation (op)** | Pluggable handler — audit, limit, firewall, … |
| **SCI** | Self-Centered Intelligence — agents reasoning from own center within constitution |
| **Sequencer** | Ordered prescriptive step pipeline inside session (v0.2) |
| **Session ID** | One runtime activation |
| **Soma** | Body / host while running |
| **SoulSig** | Birth contract on Live ID |
| **Spectrum** | See Aura Spectrum |
| **Trust tier** | ephemeral · unverified · verified_live_id |
| **Type** | Registered plugin kind — `arpa.brain.gemini`, etc. |
| **UBH** | Ultimate Beneficiary Human |
